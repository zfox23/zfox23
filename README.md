### Hello üòä
Thanks for stopping by! I'm Zach Fox (he/him), and I'm a software engineer and [photographer](https://zachfox.photography) living in the Washington DC area.

## Main Software Project
Professionally, I was most recently a tech lead at [High Fidelity](https://highfidelity.com), where I worked with a small team of lovely, talented folks. We enabled developers to implement high-quality spatial audio into their applications and games.

üëÇ Want to hear what that sounds like? [Click here for a demo of the technology I helped build.](https://map.highfidelity.com/x28jmHHCob/?mapJSON=https%3A%2F%2Fbackgrounds.highfidelity.com%2Fzaru6.json&x=21.72&y=33.68&o=1.41)

**At HiFi, I was responsible for:**
- The architecure and implementation of the [Spatial Audio API](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi-spatial-audio-js) (TypeScript)
- Writing and deploying [the documentation for the Spatial Audio API](https://docs.highfidelity.com) (TSDoc, TypeDoc)
- Overseeing the development of and contributing to [our Spatial Audio API Example projects repository](https://github.com/highfidelity/Spatial-Audio-API-Examples/) (NodeJS, JavaScript)
- Writing the HTML/CSS/JS code for [our API website](https://www.highfidelity.com/api) and integrating that with the HubSpot CMS (NodeJS, JS, EJS, HubL)
- Leading a team of two developers as we help each other grow as engineers and as people
