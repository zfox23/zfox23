### Hello! üòä
Thanks for stopping by! I'm Zach Fox (he/him), and I'm a software engineer and [photographer](https://zachfox.photography) living in Brooklyn, New York.

**TL;DR: [Here's my resume.](https://afriendlyfox.com/ZacharyFoxResume.pdf)**

## Main Software Project
My main software-related project is [my photography website, Zach Fox Photography](https://zachfox.photography), and its sibling site, [Zach Fox Fine Art Photography](https://art.zachfox.photography). Those two sites are written using Gatsby, React, TailwindCSS, and Express.

I've learned immensely from starting my own business, and my websites have gone through several design and implementation iterations over time. Those iterations have been fueled by a desire to learn the latest Web development technology, a desire for a great user experience, and a desire to make my site better than anything I could create with a photography site builder like Smugmug.

## High Fidelity
My most recent full-time position was Lead Applications Developer at [High Fidelity](https://highfidelity.com), where I worked with a small team of lovely, talented folks. We enabled developers to implement high-quality spatial audio into their applications and games.

**At HiFi, I was most recently responsible for:**
- The architecure and implementation of the [Spatial Audio API](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi-spatial-audio-js) (TypeScript, Swift)
- Writing and deploying the documentation and guides for the Spatial Audio API (TSDoc, TypeDoc)
- Overseeing the development of and contributing to [our Spatial Audio API Example projects repository](https://github.com/highfidelity/Spatial-Audio-API-Examples/) (NodeJS, JavaScript, Swift)
- Writing the HTML/CSS/JS code for our initial API Docs and Guides website and integrating that with the HubSpot CMS (NodeJS, JS, EJS, HubL)
- Leading a team of two developers as we help each other grow as engineers and as people
