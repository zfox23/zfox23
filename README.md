### Hello! üòä
Thanks for stopping by! I'm Zach Fox üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (he/they), and I'm a Web developer and [photographer](https://zachfox.photography) currently living in Queens, New York.

[You can access my resume here.](https://zachfox.io/ZacharyFoxResume.pdf)

## Zach Fox Photography
My main software-related passion project is [my photography website, Zach Fox Photography](https://zachfox.photography). I wrote ZFP using Gatsby, React, TailwindCSS, and Express.

I've learned immensely from starting my own business, and my websites have gone through several design and implementation iterations over time. Those iterations have been fueled by a desire to learn the latest Web development technology, a desire for a great user experience, and a desire to make my site better than anything I could create with a photography site builder like Smugmug.

## Mozilla
In July 2023, I joined the [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com) team as a contract Senior Software Engineer, where I focused mainly on the WebRTC components of their virtual world platform. In October 2023, I became a member of [the MDN Content Team](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), doing...all sorts of stuff. It's a whirlwind!

## Croquet
In late November 2022, I joined [Croquet](https://croquet.io) as an Engineering Product Manager and Developer Relations Engineer. I'm super excited about Metaverse technologies and about helping others express themselves more authentically using the Metaverse as a medium.

## High Fidelity
I was a Lead Applications Developer at [High Fidelity](https://highfidelity.com), where I worked with a small team of lovely, talented folks. We enabled developers to implement high-quality spatial audio into their applications and games.

**At HiFi, I was most recently responsible for:**
- The architecure and implementation of the [Spatial Audio API](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi-spatial-audio-js) (TypeScript, Swift)
- Writing and deploying the documentation and guides for the Spatial Audio API (TSDoc, TypeDoc)
- Overseeing the development of and contributing to [our Spatial Audio API Example projects repository](https://github.com/highfidelity/Spatial-Audio-API-Examples/) (NodeJS, JavaScript, Swift)
- Writing the HTML/CSS/JS code for our initial API Docs and Guides website and integrating that with the HubSpot CMS (NodeJS, JS, EJS, HubL)
- Leading a team of two developers as we help each other grow as engineers and as people
